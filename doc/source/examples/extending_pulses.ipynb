    "# Extending pulses\n",
    "This example notebook demonstrates how to remap and extend pulses to different qubits. That is, we can map several ``PulseSequence`` instances to different qubits, thus extending existing pulses defined on different Hilbert spaces, or permute the qubit register a pulse is defined on, without having to define new pulses on the larger Hilbert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functionality is provided by `remap` and `extend`, which, similar to `concatenate`, automatically cache the control matrix and diagonalization attributes for the extended pulse if they are also cached for the mapped pulses. This is only possible for separable bases, that is, bases that can be written as $\\mathcal{C}_n = \\mathcal{C}_1^{\\otimes n}$ with $\\mathcal{C}_1$ the basis for a single qubit. Currently, the only implemented basis that fulfills this criterium is the Pauli basis $\\mathcal{P}_n = \\lbrace\\mathbb{1},\\sigma_x,\\sigma_y,\\sigma_z\\rbrace^{\\otimes n}/d^\\frac{n}{2}$.\n",

    "Concretely, we will define a simple SWAP pulse that will swap the outer two and inner two qubits of a four-qubit register, such as is needed in a QFT.\n",

As mentioned above, this can be achieved using ``extend``. The function's only positional argument is a mapping of ``PulseSequence``s to qubits in a list of lists format similar to the Hamiltonian format required by the ``PulseSequence`` constructor. In this case, we want to map the Hadamard pulse to the second qubit (indexed by `1`). By default, operator identifiers are mapped by appending the qubit index to the identifier.
