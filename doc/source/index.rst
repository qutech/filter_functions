Welcome to ``filter_functions``'s documentation! The ``filter_functions`` package aims to be an easy-to-use software package for the efficient calculation and analysis of generalized filter functions for arbitrary pulse sequences.

The documentation consists of Jupyter notebooks that can either be run interactively (they can be found in ``doc/source/examples``) or you can read static versions of them here. While they are all self-consistent, they introduce the key concepts incrementally and are thus best followed chronologically. Additionally, there is an extensive API documentation.
