    "# First steps\n",
    "### Really short introduction to filter functions\n",
    "In the filter function formalism one tries to quantify the decoherence of a qubit subject to a given control operation, or 'pulse sequence', by capturing the susceptibility of the system undergoing the time evolution generated by the control operation to noise in the frequency domain in a so-called 'filter function', $F(\\omega)$. Then, with the noise expressed through its (two-sided) power spectral density $S(\\omega)$, the decoherence function is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    W(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\chi(t)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\chi(t) = \\frac{1}{d}\\int\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega}{2\\pi} F(\\omega) S(\\omega).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the decoherence can be very intuitively understood and studied by examining the filter function in the frequency domain -- if it is large, the system will be very susceptible to noise at that frequency, while if it is small, noise of that frequency will be 'filtered out'. In this regard, the filter function is very similar to the transfer function of electrical circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other filter functions than the one *fidelity* filter function above which describes phase coherence may be defined in a similar way and obtained as linear combinations of *generalized* filter functions. These functions are defined with respect to an orthonormal operator basis $\\lbrace C_k\\rbrace_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ and the fidelity filter function, for example, may be obtained from them by tracing out the basis indices, $F(\\omega) = \\mathrm{tr}(F_{kl}(\\omega))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `PulseSequence` class\n",
    "The central object of this package is the `PulseSequence` class. It is used to represent the control operation implementing a certain Hamiltonian ${H}_c$ and the sensitivities of the noise afflicting the system. More concisely, the total Hamiltonian of the system is modelled as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{H} &= {H}_c + {H}_n \\\\\n",
    "{H}_c &= \\sum_i a_i(t) A_i \\\\\n",
    "{H}_n &= \\sum_\\alpha s_\\alpha(t) b_\\alpha(t) B_\\alpha \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_i$ and $B_\\alpha$ are the control and noise operators, respectively, $a_i(t)$ the control strength of $A_i$ at time $t$, $s_\\alpha(t)$ a deterministic time dependence of the noise operators to model, for instance, non-linear coupling to the noise sources, and $b_\\alpha(t)$ classically fluctuating noise variables. Since the noise is captured in a spectral density function that accounts for different realizations of the random noise, the $b_\\alpha(t)$ are not required at instantiation of a `PulseSequence` instance. Note that we always calculate in units where $\\hbar\\equiv 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PulseSequence` class requires three positional arguments at instantiation; `H_c`, `H_n`, and `dt`, with `dt` the time-deltas of piece-wise constant control. The former two represent the control and noise Hamiltonians and are passed in the same nested-list-of-lists structure of operators and coefficient lists similar to that required by [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) (the difference being that QuTiP requires implicit functions for calculating the coefficients instead of explicit values). Optionally, we pass unique identifiers for each operator as a third element of the list. That is, \n",

As the FID experiment simply lets the qubit evolve freely for a variable time, the pulse sequence is particularly simple: we do nothing (since we do not do an actual experiment we don't need to rotate the Bloch vector onto the equator and back up for measurement).\n",
